- 👋 Hi, I’m @Courtney!
-     A little bit about me.....
- 👀 I love winters in AZ, crawfish and Mardi Gras season back home in LA, and being as far out in the nature as possible, as much as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, MySQL, and MySQL Workbench.  I continue to practice using HTML and CSS in all of my projects as well.  I learned that a few weeks ago.  I have to say, this has for sure been one of the hardest things Ive ever attempted but despite my brain having a melt down I'm loving every minute of it.  I spend about 90% of my time glued to my computer learning as much as I can. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything with anyone.  Pratice makes closer to perfect so lets get it!!
- 📫 How to reach me?? ... You can just leave a message here! :)

Looking forward to meeting new friends and networking with other like minded humans!!
